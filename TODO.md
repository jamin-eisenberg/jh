- refreshing on story/help pages leads to overflow over title
- link JH icon in help description
- minimap JH showing location of current icon
- limit zoom and prevent landscape (hmm, landscape only looks bad because of the current image size I think)
- size background image against viewport (re-evaluate with actual image dims)
- test rawStories has no duplicate icons
- increase text size on zoom on story page?
- open image alone on tap, then can zoom from there?
- image hosting on cloudinary (see API interaction at cloudinary_api.py scratch file)
- test that all referenced icons and images are present in images/ (or on Cloudinary)
- preprocess hitbox coordinates and save all as icons (python script)
